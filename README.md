### A strategyproof, privacy-preserving negotiation protocol with:

- Dominant-strategy truthfulness
- No trusted third party
- Guaranteed fairness and mutual surplus
- No post-negotiation regret or information leakage

In other words: **honest, chill, efficient deals**.

---

### üîë Core Protocol

Each party commits to:

- **A true cutoff**: Max Bid for the buyer, Min Ask for the seller
- Running the protocol **only once**, to prevent probing/gaming

The protocol does:

1. **Privately compares** the two values
2. If there‚Äôs **no overlap** (Max Bid < Min Ask), outputs: `‚ùå no overlap, sorry`
3. If there **is overlap** (Max Bid ‚â• Min Ask), outputs: `‚úÖ fair price` computed as:

```
fair_price = randomIntegerBetween(seller_min_ask, buyer_max_bid)
```

### üß† Why the Uniform Random Price

- **Privacy-preserving:** Reveals less about the individual inputs than midpoint
- **Truth-inducing:** There‚Äôs no advantage to lying
- **Surplus-sharing:** On average, splits the surplus evenly, but with variance
- **Prevents anchoring:** Neither party controls the framing
- **Repeatable fairness:** Over time, expected outcomes balance out

### üìà Economic Implications

If adopted:

- Massive drop in **negotiation friction costs**
- Faster resolution of deals, from personal favors to billion-dollar M&A
- Could lead to market design upgrades‚Äîe.g., in labor markets, procurement, B2B deals, etc.
- Strategically, **defangs aggressive negotiation tactics**, encouraging better long-term relationships

### üéØ ‚ÄúOne-Shot‚Äù Commitment = Strategic Key

If parties **only get one shot**, then:

- **Low-balling** risks missing a deal that would have cleared
- **Overreporting** (e.g., seller feigns less than they'd really accept) risks accepting a worse price than you‚Äôd be happy with

The **dominant strategy becomes truth-telling** ‚Äî _if the surplus is shared fairly and you‚Äôre guaranteed no second chances_.

#### ‚úÖ&nbsp; If the one-shot commitment holds:

- **Truthful bidding is the dominant strategy**.
- **Bluffing** (e.g. underbidding) **risks losing a surplus-positive deal**.
- Overbidding (e.g. seller claims lower Min Ask than real) **risks accepting a bad deal**.
- Since no retries are allowed, you‚Äôre incentivized to **be honest** to avoid missing out or being exploited.

This is what makes it **strategyproof**.

#### ‚ùå&nbsp; If the one-shot commitment does not hold:

- Parties can **probe**, e.g. by low-balling first to see if it clears.
- If it doesn‚Äôt, they try again with a higher/lower value.
- This reintroduces **brinkmanship, gaming, and delay**.
- We‚Äôre back to standard adversarial negotiation dynamics ‚Äî what we‚Äôre trying to rise out of.

So: **one-shot-ness is critical** to preserving honesty incentives.

### üí° Summary of Strategyproof Conditions

To make this system strategyproof:

1. **Single-shot protocol** ‚Äî enforced by social norm, legal agreement, or smart contract
2. **Random fair price within overlap range** ‚Äî prevents anchoring or manipulation
3. **Clear surplus-sharing mechanism** ‚Äî ensures both parties gain, discouraging brinkmanship
4. **No benefit to misreporting** ‚Äî lies risk either:
   - Missing the deal (if too aggressive)
   - Getting a worse outcome (if too conservative)

If those are met, **truth-telling is optimal** ‚Äî and we have a strategyproof negotiation protocol.

## One-Shot Agreements

### Type 1 - Verbal/Social One-Shot Agreement

- **Defends against**: multi-round bluffing, overhead of adversarial games
- **Enforcement**: purely psychological / social
- **Upside**: simple, low-cost, ideal for trustful contexts
- **Downside**: requires mutual discipline; if one party breaks the agreement, there‚Äôs no consequence unless the other retaliates (reputation, future dealings, etc.)
- **Best fit**: friends, collaborators, small teams, those playing repeated games

This protocol works best when both parties value honesty, speed, clarity, and long-term relationship over short-term extraction.

#### Example One-Shot Negotiation Agreement:

> We each have a **private cut-off point** ‚Äî our true minimum (seller) or maximum (buyer) for doing this deal.
>
> We agree to run this protocol _**once**_, honestly inputting our true values.
>
> If there‚Äôs **no overlap**, we both walk away with no hard feelings.  
> If there **is an overlap**, the protocol will pick a fair price in that range, and we commit to accepting the outcome.
>
> No retries, no second rounds, no re-opening the negotiation afterward.

### Type 2 - For high-stakes deals, Legal One-Shot Contract

Violating it could void enforceability of the result, or trigger penalty clauses.

- **Defends against**: strategic probing in corporate deals, ‚Äúwalk then re-offer‚Äù behavior
- **Enforcement**: contract law
- **Upside**: externalized enforcement; clearly legible consequence (e.g. invalidating deal or triggering penalties)
- **Downside**: overhead, lawyer involvement, harder to use in fast-paced or informal settings
- **Best fit**: Large investment deals, acquisitions, licensing negotiations, real estate
